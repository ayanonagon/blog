Hi, I'm Ayaka.

I'm an iOS developer currently at Venmo. This is my blog, which I may or may not update. In the meanwhile, checkout (and maybe fork) my latest project, [Parsimmon](https://github.com/ayanonagon/Parsimmon) [linguistics toolkit for iOS].

You can find my tweets [@ayanonagon](https://twitter.com/ayanonagon).
